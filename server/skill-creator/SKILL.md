# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies.

Check available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier (kebab-case, lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only)
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to "undertrigger" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit "pushy". So for instance, instead of "How to build a dashboard to display data.", you might write "How to build a dashboard to display data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, metrics, or wants to display any kind of data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"
- **the rest of the skill content :)**

## Skill Writing Guide

### Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:
```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
```
Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this:
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

## Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

## Improving the skill

### How to think about improvements

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** We're trying to create skills that can be used across many different prompts. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working.

2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. If it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that.

3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important.

## Reference files

The references/ directory has additional documentation:
- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.

Good luck!
